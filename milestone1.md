## Section 1: Overview

> The Canadian taxpayer is the single largest investor in Canada's Olympians and Paralympians to the tune of about $200-million spent annually on high-performance sport.  
> Own The Podium makes funding recommendations directing $70-million of it annually money – about $6-million of that comes from the Canadian Olympic Committee – to sports federations whose athletes demonstrate medal potential.

How do governments decide which sports to allocate their limited sporting budgets towards? There is great pride in improving medal counts at the olympics. The Minister of Sport (or equivalent) in every country is almost certainly confronted with the question of: __which Olympic events, if invested in appropriately, would be most likely to produce medalists for our country?__

We will build a dashboard that helps to answer this question using 120 years of historic Olympic results for all participating athletes.

## Section 2: Description of the data

The data we will use was compiled by Randi H Griffin and is [publicly available on Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results#athlete_events.csv).

This dataset contains approximately 271,000 results for unique combinations of athlete, event, and year.There are 134,732 unique athletes, 765 unique events (grouped into 66 sports like swimming, rowing, and figure skating), and 35 unique years (Summer Olympics since 1896, Winter Olympics since 1994).

We will display medal counts split by some of the athlete characteristics, such as Sex, Age, Height, and Weight. Perhaps the Minister of Sport may also want to filter the entire dashboard based on these characteristics.
